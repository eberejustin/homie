# HOMIE
Crisis response app for homeless people

## Background
In many areas in America, families have had to watch their incomes fall while their housing costs soar. According to The Guardian, today, the majority of poor renting families in America spend over half their income on housing, and at least 1 in 4 dedicate over 70 percent of their income to paying rent and keeping the lights on.
The fact is, fewer and fewer families can afford a roof over their head.
While not everyone living in a distressed neighborhood is associated with gang members, domestic issues, employers, or drug and alcohol abuse. But almost all of them have a landlord or are experiencing homelessness.
Whether you don't know where you're going to sleep that night or you're scared about what might happen in the future, we're here to help.

## What it does
Our website allows for anyone facing the issue of homelessness to not be afraid of what could come. It provides locations, phone numbers, and descriptions of the nearest shelters for emergency housing and transitional housing based off benefits that they might not know about (Gender, Family, Military Status, etc.), resources and guides for whatever their status may be (homeless, approaching homelessness, about to be evicted), and an easy way to look up if an area is rising in costs to see if the area is at risk of being gentrified.

## Implementation
The frontend is a combination of jQuery, bootstrap and the google Maps API. The backend was implemented in [Onedb](https://one-db.org), the new app on the block that handles everything backend including deployment, database queries and server side code.

### The app is hosted on github pages at https://homie.github.io
